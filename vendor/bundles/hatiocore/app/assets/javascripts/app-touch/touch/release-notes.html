					<li>General Notes
						<ul>
              <li>This release provides full compatibility with Touch 2.0.0. Various examples have been revisited to apply the new MVC pattern to writing apps. New visualizations have been included 
              such as TreeMap, Sunburst, Wordmap and Icicle visualizations. New examples have been written for these new visualizations. The animation package for graphics has gone through a re-design and 
              implementation and faster algorithms for path manipulation have been added.
